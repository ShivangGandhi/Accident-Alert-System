# Accident-Alert-System
###AcciLERT(The Accident Detection and Alert System using Arduino) is very sufficient and worthy to be
implemented in the vehicle especially in developing countries like Nepal, India, Bangladesh etc. Accidents are
increasing due to an increase in the number of vehicles as a result every year the number of deaths is increasing.
The Accident Detection and Alert System using Arduino prevents the uncertain death after an accident because
this system sends the message alert to the hospital or police station. The message alert includes longitude, latitude
(location of accident), in the form of google map link.
The Technologies used in this system can enhance the traffic and are cost efficient to be fit for any car due to its
size. This system can efficiently detect an accident on the roads, with the help of input sensors i.e. the vibration
module which could be fit inside air bags and the gyroscope accelerometer sensor which helps the system detect
sensors.
Though there are cases when there is a false alarm or the accident is minor. So to overcome this the system is built
so efficiently that the driver gets 10 seconds to press the false alarm button and deactivate the SMS system that is
used to notify nearby Hospitals and Police Stations.
When the accident is not minor and the driver is unconscious, this system sends an sms to the registered relatives
on the app as well to the nearby hospitals and police station immediately after waiting for 10 seconds, Hence saving
the life of the commuters in the vehicle.
